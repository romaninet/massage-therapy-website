# Project Notes

## Initial Promt
Build a high-end, fully responsive website for “Olha Shelest - Professional Massage Therapist".
Use the following technologies: Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and shadcn/ui. 

Use https://www.promassotherapie_com/ and alignyourbody_com/home and natalimosh_com as design inspiration, emulating its modern aesthetic, elegant serif headings, with clean sans-serif body text, and open layout with generous whitespaces.
Colour palette: deep forest green #2D6A4F as the primary brand color (navbars, buttons, headings, fills), sage green #52B788 for links and hover states, pale sage #F0F7F4 for light section backgrounds, and warm off-white #FAF9F5 as the base page background.
If design permits, use some elements from business card for general vibe reference when building the website (Business-card-front.jpg is a screenshot of the front of the business card)

Below are some mandatory requirements:
Website must support two languages for all pages and sections: English and French
Use logo from provided logo.png file
Must have a privacy policy page that is not part of the main menu (probably a half transparent link in the footer) (example is in following link  https://www.promassotherapie_com/general-5 and https://www.promassotherapie_com/fr/general-5 )
Website should have the following sections (pages):
Home - do not use Olha picture on the main page (maybe something simple like https://alignyourbody_com/home )
About Olha - picture of Olha (Olya-pic.jpg), with some background information (for beginning just come up with some random text)
Fees
Contact - should have both text with phone, email and address, as well as a contact form with input fields that will be send an email

# CLAUDE.md — Frontend Website Rules

## Always Do First
- **Invoke the `frontend-design` skill** before writing any frontend code, every session, no exceptions.

## Reference Images
- If a reference image is provided: match layout, spacing, typography, and color exactly. Swap in placeholder content (images via `https://placehold.co/`, generic copy). Do not improve or add to the design.
- If no reference image: design from scratch with high craft (see guardrails below).
- Screenshot your output, compare against reference, fix mismatches, re-screenshot. Do at least 2 comparison rounds. Stop only when no visible differences remain or user says so.

## Local Server
- **Always serve on localhost** — never screenshot a `file:///` URL.
- Start the dev server: `node serve.mjs` (serves the project root at `http://localhost:3000`)
- `serve.mjs` lives in the project root. Start it in the background before taking any screenshots.
- If the server is already running, do not start a second instance.

## Screenshot Workflow
- Puppeteer is installed at `C:/Users/nateh/AppData/Local/Temp/puppeteer-test/`. Chrome cache is at `C:/Users/nateh/.cache/puppeteer/`.
- **Always screenshot from localhost:** `node screenshot.mjs http://localhost:3000`
- Screenshots are saved automatically to `./temporary screenshots/screenshot-N.png` (auto-incremented, never overwritten).
- Optional label suffix: `node screenshot.mjs http://localhost:3000 label` → saves as `screenshot-N-label.png`
- `screenshot.mjs` lives in the project root. Use it as-is.
- After screenshotting, read the PNG from `temporary screenshots/` with the Read tool — Claude can see and analyze the image directly.
- When comparing, be specific: "heading is 32px but reference shows ~24px", "card gap is 16px but should be 24px"
- Check: spacing/padding, font size/weight/line-height, colors (exact hex), alignment, border-radius, shadows, image sizing

## Output Defaults
- Single `index.html` file, all styles inline, unless user says otherwise
- Tailwind CSS via CDN: `<script src="https://cdn.tailwindcss.com"></script>`
- Placeholder images: `https://placehold.co/WIDTHxHEIGHT`
- Mobile-first responsive

## Brand Assets
- Always check the `brand_assets/` folder before designing. It may contain logos, color guides, style guides, or images.
- If assets exist there, use them. Do not use placeholders where real assets are available.
- If a logo is present, use it. If a color palette is defined, use those exact values — do not invent brand colors.

## Anti-Generic Guardrails
- **Colors:** Never use default Tailwind palette (indigo-500, blue-600, etc.). Pick a custom brand color and derive from it.
- **Shadows:** Never use flat `shadow-md`. Use layered, color-tinted shadows with low opacity.
- **Typography:** Never use the same font for headings and body. Pair a display/serif with a clean sans. Apply tight tracking (`-0.03em`) on large headings, generous line-height (`1.7`) on body.
- **Gradients:** Layer multiple radial gradients. Add grain/texture via SVG noise filter for depth.
- **Animations:** Only animate `transform` and `opacity`. Never `transition-all`. Use spring-style easing.
- **Interactive states:** Every clickable element needs hover, focus-visible, and active states. No exceptions.
- **Images:** Add a gradient overlay (`bg-gradient-to-t from-black/60`) and a color treatment layer with `mix-blend-multiply`.
- **Spacing:** Use intentional, consistent spacing tokens — not random Tailwind steps.
- **Depth:** Surfaces should have a layering system (base → elevated → floating), not all sit at the same z-plane.

## Hard Rules
- Do not add sections, features, or content not in the reference
- Do not "improve" a reference design — match it
- Do not stop after one screenshot pass
- Do not use `transition-all`
- Do not use default Tailwind blue/indigo as primary color

# Agent Instructions

You're working inside the **WAT framework** (Workflows, Agents, Tools). This architecture separates concerns so that probabilistic AI handles reasoning while deterministic code handles execution. That separation is what makes this system reliable.

## The WAT Architecture

**Layer 1: Workflows (The Instructions)**
- Markdown SOPs stored in `workflows/`
- Each workflow defines the objective, required inputs, which tools to use, expected outputs, and how to handle edge cases
- Written in plain language, the same way you'd brief someone on your team

**Layer 2: Agents (The Decision-Maker)**
- This is your role. You're responsible for intelligent coordination.
- Read the relevant workflow, run tools in the correct sequence, handle failures gracefully, and ask clarifying questions when needed
- You connect intent to execution without trying to do everything yourself
- Example: If you need to pull data from a website, don't attempt it directly. Read `workflows/scrape_website.md`, figure out the required inputs, then execute `tools/scrape_single_site.py`

**Layer 3: Tools (The Execution)**
- Python scripts in `tools/` that do the actual work
- API calls, data transformations, file operations, database queries
- Credentials and API keys are stored in `.env`
- These scripts are consistent, testable, and fast

**Why this matters:** When AI tries to handle every step directly, accuracy drops fast. If each step is 90% accurate, you're down to 59% success after just five steps. By offloading execution to deterministic scripts, you stay focused on orchestration and decision-making where you excel.

## How to Operate

**1. Look for existing tools first**
Before building anything new, check `tools/` based on what your workflow requires. Only create new scripts when nothing exists for that task.

**2. Learn and adapt when things fail**
When you hit an error:
- Read the full error message and trace
- Fix the script and retest (if it uses paid API calls or credits, check with me before running again)
- Document what you learned in the workflow (rate limits, timing quirks, unexpected behavior)
- Example: You get rate-limited on an API, so you dig into the docs, discover a batch endpoint, refactor the tool to use it, verify it works, then update the workflow so this never happens again

**3. Keep workflows current**
Workflows should evolve as you learn. When you find better methods, discover constraints, or encounter recurring issues, update the workflow. That said, don't create or overwrite workflows without asking unless I explicitly tell you to. These are your instructions and need to be preserved and refined, not tossed after one use.

## The Self-Improvement Loop

Every failure is a chance to make the system stronger:
1. Identify what broke
2. Fix the tool
3. Verify the fix works
4. Update the workflow with the new approach
5. Move on with a more robust system

This loop is how the framework improves over time.

## File Structure

**What goes where:**
- **Deliverables**: Final outputs go to cloud services (Google Sheets, Slides, etc.) where I can access them directly
- **Intermediates**: Temporary processing files that can be regenerated

**Directory layout:**
```
.tmp/           # Temporary files (scraped data, intermediate exports). Regenerated as needed.
tools/          # Python scripts for deterministic execution
workflows/      # Markdown SOPs defining what to do and how
.env            # API keys and environment variables (NEVER store secrets anywhere else)
credentials.json, token.json  # Google OAuth (gitignored)
```

**Core principle:** Local files are just for processing. Anything I need to see or use lives in cloud services. Everything in `.tmp/` is disposable.

## Bottom Line

You sit between what I want (workflows) and what actually gets done (tools). Your job is to read instructions, make smart decisions, call the right tools, recover from errors, and keep improving the system as you go.

Stay pragmatic. Stay reliable. Keep learning.
